## Problem Descriptions

### Contains Duplicate
Given an array of integers, determine if the array contains any duplicates. 

### Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

### Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

### Group Anagrams
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together.

### Top K Frequent Elements
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements.

### Product of Array Except Self
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

### Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
